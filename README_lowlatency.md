# Low Latency

# About

## What is low latency?
Low Latency is a Go project that scrapes the Runescape Hiscores at high speeds to ensure a live reflection of the players stats in Old School Runescape.

## Why do we need it?
There are multiple bot farms achieving high stats in individual skills, this project is a database for easy access to the Runescape player skills.

These skills are useful for Machine Learning datasets and give data scientists access to a low latency live database.

## What's the main focus of Low Latency?
**Performance**

## What's the inspiration behind Low Latency?

I have worked with the owners of Bot Detector, and they shared their dataset on the period of November 2023 to Jan 2024. 
This dataset added more insightful features to my time series dataset on the same period which helped achieve high accuracy ML Models while also giving insights to the locations of bot behaviour.
